A Tree is typically traversed in two ways. These are - 

    1. Depth First Search
    2. Breadth First Search (Level Order Traversal)

The "Depth First Search" or "DFS" is further classified into three types -

    1. Inorder Traversal
    2. Preorder Traversal
    3. Postorder Traversal

So, there are four different ways to traverse a tree.

But why there are different ways?

That's because many times when solving a problem, a specific traversal technique might be better than other techniques. All the traversal techniques require O(n) time because they visit every node exactly once. But, when it comes to Space Complexity, there is a difference in the extra space used.

 - Extra Space required for Breadth First Search or Level Order Traversal is O(w) where w is maximum width of Binary Tree. In BFS, a queue one by one stores nodes of different level.
 - Extra Space required for Depth First Traversals is O(h) where h is maximum height of Binary Tree. In Depth First Traversals, stack (or function call stack) stores all ancestors of a node.
