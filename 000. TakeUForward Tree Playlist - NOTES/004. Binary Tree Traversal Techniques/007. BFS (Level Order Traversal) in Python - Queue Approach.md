The most efficient way for a Level Order Traversal is using a Queue data structure and the algorithm is super simple.

A Queue lets us push and pop from both ends - front and rear. 

The idea is that, as we traverse the nodes in the queue (which are the nodes in current level), we will also keep pushing their left and right children into the queue which would be the nodes for the next level.

In the worst case, for example in case of left or rigth skewed trees, the time complexity if O(N) because for a skewed tree with "N" nodes, there are "N" levels.

Let's take an example to understand the queue approach.

Suppose we have the above tree. 

Initially, we will have a queue with just the root of the tree in it. 

So, initially, the queue has the node {3} in it.

Now, while the queue is not empty, we will perform the following operations - 

    1. Go over all the nodes currently in this queue (They are the nodes for the current level)
    2. For each node, print its value
    3. And for each node, push the left and right children back in to the queue so that they can be processed in next iteration

So, taking the above example, we start with a queue having just the root node {3}.

Then, we start processing.

Currently, queue has {3} in it which means at level 0, we have only one node {3}. So, we print it and then push its left and right children in to the queue.

So, by the end of this iteration, queue has {9} and {20} in it.

Now, in next iteration, we have two nodes {9} and {20} in the queue which means at level 1, we have two nodes. So, we first print the value of {9}, push its left and right children in the queue (there aren't any in the above example so nothing is pushed), and then we print the value of {20} and push left and right children in the queue.

So, by the end of this iteration, queue has {15} and {7}

And so, we process them and since they don't have any further children, our queue is finally empty so the loop ends.

And that's the simple queue approach.

Here is how the code looks like in Python - 


    def levelOrder(root):
            
        # A deque
        queue = deque()
            
        # Put the root in the queue initially
        queue.append(root)
            
        # While the queue is not empty
        while queue:
                
            # At any time, the number of nodes in queue are all the nodes for that particular level
            # How many nodes are there in current level?
            nodesInCurrentLevel = len(queue)
                
            # Go over all the nodes
            while nodesInCurrentLevel > 0:
                    
                # Take the node from left of the queue
                node = queue.popleft()
                    
                # Print the node's value
                print(node.val)
                    
                # If there is a left child, push it to the queue
                if node.left: queue.append(node.left)
                        
                # If there is a right child, push it to the queue
                if node.right: queue.append(node.right)
                        
                # Update "nodesInCurrentLevel"
                nodesInCurrentLevel -= 1
