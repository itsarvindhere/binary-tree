We have already seen how to do Post-Order Tree Traversal using Recursion in Python.

But, we can also do it Iteratively. For that, we will need a "Stack" data structure, which is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure.

As we know, "Post-Order" traversal follow a "Left Right Root" approach.

Now, if you think a bit, the "Pre-Order traversal" follows a "Root Left Right" approach. And in the iterative approach for "Pre-Order" traversal, we do something like this - 

        # Take the top of the stack and print its value
        top = stack.pop()
        print(top.val)
                
        # Now, push the "right" child of the top node into the stack (if it exists)
        if top.right: stack.append(top.right)
                
        # And finally, push the "left" child of the top node into the stack (if it exists)
        if top.left: stack.append(top.left)


What if we reverse the order in which we push the children in the stack? That is, what if we first push the left child and then the right child?

In that case, this will become "Root Right Left" and that's simply the reverse of "Left Right Root" which is the Post-Order traversal.

And that's the idea here.

We can simply reverse the order in which we push the nodes to the stack in "Pre-Order" code, and that will give us the "Post-Order" traversal's result (in reverse order).

It is even easier to understand if we take an example.

Suppose we have the above tree.

What is the "ROOT RIGHT LEFT" traversal of this tree? That would be - 

    1 3 7 10 9 6 2 5 8 4

And what is the "POST-ORDER" traversal (LEFT RIGHT ROOT) of this tree? That would be -

    4 8 5 2 6 9 10 7 3 1

And so, we can see that the "POST-ORDER" traversal is simply the reverse of "ROOT RIGHT LEFT" traversal. 

And we can get the "ROOT RIGHT LEFT" traversal by simply modifying the code of "Pre-Order" traversal.


So, the code is something like this - 

    def postorderTraversal(root):
            
        # Output list to return
        output = []
            
        # If there is no node at all, return []
        if not root: return output
            
        # Initially with "root" node
        stack = [root]
            
        # While stack is not empty
        while stack:
                
            # Pop the top of the stack into output list
            top = stack.pop()
            output.append(top.val)
                
            # IN PRE-ORDER, we first push "right" and then "left" but here we do the opposite
            # Because we want to do the "ROOT RIGHT LEFT" traversal
            
            # If the "top" has a left child, put it in stack 
            if top.left: stack.append(top.left) <- IN PRE-ORDER, we first push "right" and then "left" but here we do the opposite>
                    
            # If the "top" has a right child, put it in stack
            if top.right: stack.append(top.right)
                
        # Finally, return the output list in reverse
        return reversed(output)
