Post-order traversal is defined as a type of tree traversal that follows the Left-Right-Root policy where:

 - The left subtree is traversed first
 - Then the right subtree is traversed
 - At last, the root node of the subtree is visited

The recursive code for Post-Order Traversal is exactly the same as previous two traversals with just one change. In the Post-Order traversal, we first traverse the left subtree, then we traverse the right subtree, and then print the root node's value.

Let's say we just want to print the values. We will write a Recursive method like this - 

    def dfs(self, root):
        
        # Base case
        if not root: return
            
        # Traverse the left subtree
        self.dfs(root.left)
            
        # Traverse the right subtree
        self.dfs(root.right)

        # Print the root node's value
        print(root.val)

So, we first traverse the left subtree by making a recursive call, then we traverse the right subtree by making a recursive call, and finally we print the root node's value.

Time Complexity -> O(N), where "N" is the number of nodes.
Auxiliary Space: 
 - O(1) if no recursion stack space is considered. 
 - Otherwise, O(h) where h is the height of the tree
 - In the worst case, h can be the same as N (when the tree is a skewed tree)
 - In the best case, h can be the same as logN (when the tree is a complete tree)
  
# USES OF PRE-ORDER TRAVERSAL

 - This is used for tree deletion.
 - It is also useful to get the postfix expression from an expression tree.l.
