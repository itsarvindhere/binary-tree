# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

# EXAMPLE

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]

Explanation: There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:
5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22
5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22

# APPROACH

The approach is simple. The only thing you need to keep in mind is that lists are passed by reference. This means, when you put a list in the final output list, make sure to copy it first and then put that copy in this list. Otherwise, you will get wrong outputs.
